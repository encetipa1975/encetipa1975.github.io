It was our first product offering and how this all got started. It is perfect for people who want to try out our COSMAC FLEA without purchasing the Micro-Trainer (below). It works in all modern web browsers, and on computers, tablets, and telephones. The interface is designed like the original COSMAC ELF as published in the 1975 Popular Electronics magazine article. </p><p>Click here for RCA 1800 Microprocessor Manual Click here for the article on building the ELF Click here for the COSMAC ELF Microcomputer Manual See part number 9Z1510 for a kit to start bulding you own computer based on the CDP1802ACE. Limit 10 Per Order. 'The first project, COSMAC Elf - 30th Anniversary Edition, was developed Dec 2005 - Jan 2006. This is a microprocessor training system based on the CDP1802 microprocessor, and an Aug 1976 magazine article. The prototype was produced early Feb 2006, and the second later the same month.'</p><img src='https://www.manualsdir.com/files/788091/content/doc001.png' alt='For' title='For'><p> For all intents and purposes, it works just like the Micro-Trainer system. And its extended features, like debugging, single-step execution, memory and register display, program loading &amp; saving, and disassembly make it a nice companion piece even if you do buy the hardware version. It makes learning easier and faster. NOTE: Pixie graphics output support is coming soon. </p><p> This option is particularly useful for students at educational institutions and classroom instruction. As our most popular item, we have sold over 1,000 subscriptions to individuals in over two dozen countries, and school systems spread across over 500 schools in 7 countries, from secondary through high school, and college and university computer science programs. <br clear='both'></p><p><a href='/tftp-client-for-mac-osx.html'>/tftp-client-for-mac-osx.html</a>.

(we affectionately call it 'Blue Boy') There is something special about holding a computer that sits in your hand (or pocket) and being able to program it and work with it. It is basically based on the original COSMAC ELF, but condensed so it fits in a G'day Mints tin. Thereby our 'A ELF for Everyone!' motto. An Instruction Manual contains user information and building information for the kit form, as well as a parts list, schematics and other info. See below for books, booklets, and other manuals. And software. </p><p> The COSMAC FLEA comes pre-built (by professional, qualified technicians), or as a kit for those more adventurous. But building it is pretty simple and easy, so don't be daunted. The kit contains all of the parts you need. Both versions include a tin filled with candy mints. All you have to do is supply a soldering iron for the kit and drill some holes and cut some openings in the tin. </p><p> We also have a front panel board option to make it look nicer. And check out our expansion modules below. And if you want to roll-your-own, we have bare boards. </p><p><b>Specifications</b></p><ul><li>CPU: CDP1802 microprocessor</li><li>Clock: RC oscillator, adjustable 20-2000 KHz, and a 3.579545 MHz crystal (NTSC color burst) divided by two mode for Pixie graphics option (see below)</li><li>Memory: 32k bytes of RAM included; plus a socket for an additional 32k of RAM or EPROM.

Our Hex Keyboard and Hex Display module also fits in a tin. The 20-key keypad makes entering programs much easier. It can also be used for FLEA-8 games (see below). An additional unit can also be interfaced for two-player games. There are six .3' hex displays to show the 8-bit data bus and 16-bit address bus. Once you have learned the basics, and entered some programs using the toggle switches, you will quickly want to upgrade to a hex keyboard, and seeing the data bus and address in hex is very convenient, as well. <br clear='both'></p><p> Hex Keyboard &amp; Display ... <small>AU</small>$60 — ADD TO CART<br> Hex Keyboard w/o Display ... <small>AU</small>$35 — ADD TO CART<br></p><br><h3>COSMAC FLEA 1861 Pixie Replacement</h3><p><br> The CDP1861 Pixie display chip is rarer than hens' teeth and is almost impossible to find.

It is plug-compatible and performs the same functions. </p><p> We also have a COSMAC FLEA extension module that contains the Pixie Replacement and a sound module with a speaker, amplifier, and volume control that connects to the Q output of the COSMAC FLEA. This can be used to play music and tones. This module also fits in its own tin.
