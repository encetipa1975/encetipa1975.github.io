Monitoring the strength of the signal coming into your DAW is crucial for a correct mixing, VU meter helps you both in recording and mixing stage.<br>Know your levels before it’s too late!<br>When you record your tracks its useful to have a loudness indicator like the VU meter that with its 300ms of integration time gives you a helpful view of the perceived loudness of your signal. Used in conjunction with a peak meter it can help you to improve your miking technique since it’s always desirable to have loudness and peak value as close as possibile. VU Meter MK3 has a calibration setting that will allow you to set the 0VU point to the best level for your A/D converters (by default is set to -18dBFS but you should read the spec of your A/D and set the calibration to the specified internal headroom). This is because every A/D converter has an analog front-end and if you record too hot (close to 0dBFS) you risk to overload that analog stage.<br>Auto gain stage for quick mixing preparation<br>In mixing VU Meter is even more useful, also used in conjunction with the peak meter of your DAW can help you identify critical tracks that have too much energy in the transients and not enough loudness, but the single most useful feature is the auto gain. Gain staging is a crucial part of every mix, especially if you use analog emulating plugins, hitting them too high means creating too much distortion that then adds up in the mix.<br>To avoid this you can simply engage the automatic gain function of VU Meter MK3 that will adjust the internal gain to make the signal peak at your desired level (between -3 and +3 VU). With transient heavy sounds it may happens that auto gain boosts too much your tracks and drive them into clipping, to avoid this we have provided a max. peak ceiling that will prevent your signal from going higher than the set value.<br>The big improvement over the previous version is the addition of the grouping function, with VU Meter MK3 you can group instances of vu meters and apply auto gain, reference and color settings to every instance belonging to the same group with just one click.<br><strong>Features:</strong><br>- VU Meter spec. conformity (300ms attack and release time)<br>- VU Peak hold<br>- RED Blink clipping indicator<br>- reference level settable from -60 to 0 dBFS<br>- input gain from -30dB to +15dB<br>- bar color freely selectable<br>- Stereo automatic gain adjustment with 6 different settings<br>- Peak protection between (no peak can exceed the set limit)<br>- Auto Gain and meter setting can be set to whole group at once<br>- Eight different assignable groups<br>- Stereo display<br>- Mac OS X (&gt;=10.5 intel only) and Windows support<br>- 64bit compatibility both on Mac and Windows<br><span><span><b>Home page</b></span><br><b><span>CLiCK HERE FOR DOWNLOAD</span></b></span></div><br>[ Report broken link!!! ] <br><center><div>Donation of <b>[[value]] BTC</b> Received.
