Second, when you get a blue shell and if there is like a few people near you get as close as you can next to them. Then, as soon as the blue shell hits it will hit the other people to so if it works you should still be in first place.</p><div><h3>Nintendo Ghost Race Times</h3></div><p>To escape the POW block you have to bust a trick when it pops you into the air. You will know if it works when blue shock waves appear below you.</p><div><h3>Stopped Speed Boost</h3></div><p>This can be used on Manual or Auto-Drift. When you go off the track and hit a wall, you instantly lose all speed and have to trudge through mud or dirt and you can become extremely slow, and this can be very frustrating at times. Your first instinct is to get back onto the track, But DON'T! Instead, hold the 1 button, yes I know it sounds crazy but trust me, while holding the 1 button also hold the 2 button. You will now charge a boost, even if you have Auto-Drift! Release both buttons at the same time to blast yourself out of the rut you were in! Amazing!</p><div><h3>Avoid POW With Kart</h3></div><p>Do you love karts, but just hate the POW Block and can'tescape it? Here's the solution! All you have todo is Jump! You must have 'Manual Drift' on,obviously. Then, once it is about to hit you,hop! You will only spin once.</p><div><h3>Shortcut In N64 Bowser Castle</h3></div><p>In this race, close to the end at the last jump, you can ride on thelittle side and save a lot of time on time trial and pass somepersons on races online or computers in single. This takes a lot ofpractice so practice now!!!!!</p><div><h3>2-4 Players Being The Same Characters</h3></div><p>This cheat works for everybody but your Miis. Goto the character selection screen and have aplayer( doesn't matter which one)select his/hercharacter. Have that player get off the characterand move off the character. Repeat the processuntil the last player deselects that character(Don't have the last player move off of thecharacter). Player 1 will now go back to the SOLOand TEAM RACE/BATTLE and go back to the CHARACTERSELECTION screen. All players who did the processwill now be on the same character( If a playermoves off the character, you will have to repeatthe process). Have fun being a duplicate!!!!!! </p><div><h3>Free Star Power On Maple Treeway</h3></div><p>First, of course, go to the maple Treeway. Then, when you are at where the wigglers are, hit the first bush. You will then get a star instead of a banana or mushroom. This does not always happen. *Note* THIS DOES NOT WORK IN TIME TRIALS!</p><div><h3>Easy Way Of Getting Rosalina</h3></div><p>Okay, so you are desperate for Rosalina? Then the easy way is to have some saved data on Mario Galaxy on the Wii and then after 50 other races (if you have saved data of Mario Galaxy) you unlock Rosalina. That is how I unlocked her! </p><div><h3>Shortcut On N64 Mario Raceway</h3></div><p>On n64 Mario race way right after you come out of the tube cut through the grass (you need a set of three mushrooms, golden mushroom or a star)to use this shortcut.</p><div><h3>Same Character</h3></div><p>You can be the same character in 2-4 player byone person picking that character, than clickback and move off the character. Everyone else dothe same thing. Then when everyone has done that,go back on screen and go back to pick thecharacter again. All the players will be on onecharacter. While playing as the same character,funny things will happens. They won't harm orchange the gameplay, though.</p><div><h3>Play Friends With Mario Kart Also Online</h3></div><p>First go to Mario kart channel. Then at the top take note of your friend code (if you do not have one play at least 1 race online). Next if you have your friends code you can register it. Then you have to some how give them your friend code and have them register it. Then within 24 hours after both friend codes are registered correctly you should see their mii in your friend list and when you go to rankings. Once this is completed you can race each other online and send time trial challenges too. (must both/all be online at once and can have more than 1 registration)</p><div><h3>How To Escape A POW Block With A Bike</h3></div><p>First of all choose ANY character and choose a bike. Not a kart. Then in the last wave immediately pop a wheelie. You will spin only once and you won't looses speed. Although you will lose any item your carrying.</p><div><h3>Shortcut On Peach Garden</h3></div><p>At start of race put yourself in like 4th or 5th and try and get mushroom then after stone bridge use it to cut through the flowerbed. Really helps on time trials.</p><div><h3>Star Rank Requirements</h3></div><p>The following are requirements to get a 'OneStar', 'Two Star', or 'Three Star' rank:Get a final score of 53 or better. Lead most of the laps. Stay in first place for a good period of time. Do a lot of tricks on ramps. Avoid having to use Bullet Bills to catch up. Use lots of techniques such as wheelies, avoiding POW Blocks, etc. Do not fall off edges too much (one or two times is acceptable). If you get hit by many Spiny Shells and still win, this indicates that you are resistant and will probably have a high rank.<br>A perfect 60 is required for a 'Three Star' rank. A 'Two Star' rank ranges from 55 to 60. A 'One Star' rank is 53 to 60 with most or all of these requirements.</p><div><h3>Secret Star In Maple Treeway</h3></div><p>Go up to the part where all the Wigglers (thegiant caterpillars) are. Go to the left, and goright through the first pile of leaves. (on theleft) Most of the time, a Star will pop out! </p><div><h3>Tricks In DK Summit</h3></div><p>This can be done only by bikes. When you get tothe deep snow on the course, go up the side wall(either side works). If you do this correctly,you should see your character do a flip or spin.</p><div><h3>Avoid Blue Shells</h3></div><p>On any track with a DK cannon, while flying in the air, the blue shell will chase you then will fall behind. You will hear an explosion, but you will be unharmed.</p><div><h3>How To Block A Pow Block With A Bike</h3></div><p>When a pow block makes the ground shakes do awheelie right when it hits you would only spinonce.</p><div><h3>Dodge A Blue Shell!</h3></div><p>This move requires a boost mushroom. When theblue shell is flying through the air and stopsabove you, you click the boost just barelyescaping the blue shell.</p><div><h3>Shortcut For Moo Moo Meadows</h3></div><p>This requires a mushroom. Where the Moo Moosgather, on the last turn to the blue ramp, youcan use a mushroom to cut across the grass andsaves you time by not crashing into Moo Moos.Recommended for Time trials. </p><div><h3>How To Get A Mini-boost In Automatic Mode</h3></div><p>When lackitu drops you after you fall off a cliff, when you hit the ground press A and B at the same time until you see blue sparks, then let go of B.</p><div><h3>Howto Stop A </h3></div><p>There are a coupleways to stop a a 'POW' from hitting you; the first is to be in the air when it happes, a 'POW' can not hit any character that is in the air, this is one of the simplist ways to stop a 'POW'. The second is to hit the player that used the 'POW' before the timer runs out, this is the hardest way to stop a 'POW'. The third is to have either 'Star Power', 'Giant Mushroom', or 'Bullet Bill' activated when the timer runs out. The last is (if you have a wheel) right before the the 'POW' timer runs out jerk your controller up (as if you are a activiating a wheely with a bike. ) if you do it at the right time you should hop up and not lose any speed. You will however lose your current itme but you will if you don't do this anyways. If you use a nunchuk instead of jerking a wheel you will jerk the nunchuk piece, this should do the same as jerking the wheel, you can activate this anywhere at anytime, but be careful this can sometimes cause you to crash in areas with sharp turns.</p><div><h3>How To Skip End Credits</h3></div><p>If you hate waiting through end credits like me just hit the plus (+)button! Easy!</p><div><h3>Short Cut Rainbow Road</h3></div><p>Requires 150cc if you have any sort of mushroom and you get to the part after the blankets there's 2 giant rings and you can use them to jump over them.
