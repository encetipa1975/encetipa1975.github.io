on your MacBook Pro and the Mbox 2 Pro isn’t recognized by your computer, you will need to do basic troubleshooting to determine the source of the problem and apply corrective measures. Possible reasons that your MacBook Pro may not recognize the Mbox 2 Pro include a faulty connection between the Mbox 2 Pro’s FireWire cable and the computer, or the lack of a proper device driver for the Mbox 2 Pro. </p><p>The Mbox 2 Driver software ensures that your system has all the software components required by the Mbox 2 device to connect to the software component of your digital audio workstation (DAW). Avid Mbox Pro (3rd Generation) Drivers 1.3.2 Notes For Mac OS Note that Avid have not changed the release date but have amended the notes to include El Capitan and Pro Tools 12 support. Supports Mac OS X 10.8.5, 10.9.5, 10.10.5 & 10.11-10.11.3 Supports Pro Tools 10, 11, 12. Pro Tools TDM 6.9.2, Pro Tools TDM 6.9.3, and Pro Tools LE 6.9.2 include the option to install the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver version 6.9.2 for Pro Tools HD Accel, Pro Tools HD, Digi 002, Digi 002 Rack, and Mbox systems on Mac OS X 10.4.</p><h2>Checking FireWire Connection</h2><ul><p>The basic Mbox audio interface uses a USB cable to connect to the computer, but more sophisticated devices such as the Mbox 2 Pro use a FireWire cable. If your computer isn’t recognizing the Mbox 2 Pro, try replacing the existing FireWire cable with a new one and restarting your MacBook Pro. Then reload your Pro Tools software to see if the Mbox 2 Pro is recognized. If it is not, then you may need to install the latest device driver for the Mbox 2 Pro.</p></ul><h2>About Device Drivers for Mbox 2 Pro</h2><ul><p>Before the introduction of Avid’s Pro Tools 9 software in November 2010, and the subsequent release of Pro Tools 10 in October 2011, previous versions of Pro Tools required that you use Avid’s own branded audio interfaces to interact with the software. With these previous versions of Pro Tools, the drivers for devices such as the Mbox and the Mbox Pro came bundled with the Pro Tools software. Avid changed course a bit beginning with Pro Tools 9, in that the new software allowed numerous other audio interfaces to work for recording and mixing, but device drivers were not included with the software. So Avid created a page on its support site where many different types of drivers could be downloaded.</p></ul><h2>Installing Device Driver for Mbox 2 Pro</h2><ul><p>To find the proper driver for your Mbox 2 Pro, go online to the Avid Knowledge Base, and search for a page titled “Driver Downloads and Updates for Pro Tools and Standalone.” Scroll down to the bottom of this page and locate the link to download the driver for your Mbox 2 Pro interface, and install the driver. Then restart your MacBook Pro and start Pro Tools to see if the Mbox 2 Pro is now recognized. If the Mbox 2 Pro is still not recognized, you will need to contact Avid Pro Tools support to set up a repair.</p></ul><h2>Contacting Avid Pro Tools Support</h2><ul><p>To contact Avid Pro Tools support, go to Avid’s Contact Us Support page and click on the link under “Avid Assisted Support.” From there, you will be able to set up a support ticket and get help in setting up a repair for your Mbox 2 Pro.</p></ul><p>Digidesign CoreAudio Driver</p><p> Version 7.0 for Mac OS X 10.4 'Tiger'</p><p>Now Available — Standalone Digidesign CoreAudio Driver Version 7.0</p><p><span> If you already have Pro Tools TDM 6.9.2 or higher or Pro Tools LE 6.9.2 or higher installed on your system, you should not use the Standalone Digidesign CoreAudio Driver installer. </span>Please install the CoreAudio Driver for your system using the Pro Tools installers listed here:</p><p>If You Have Pro Tools 6.9.2/6.9.3 or Pro Tools 7 Installed on Mac OS X 10.4</p><p>Pro Tools HD 7 and Pro Tools LE 7 include the option to install the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver for systems supported by Pro Tools 7.

The CoreAudio Usage Guide and CoreAudio Read Me are installed here:</p><ul><li> Applications/Digidesign/Documentation/Drivers/</li></ul><p>Also available for separate download here:</p><ul><li>CoreAudio Usage Guide (472 k)</li><li>CoreAudio Read Me (42 k)</li></ul><p>Digidesign CoreAudio Driver Q &amp; A</p><p><span>Q: Does the Digidesign CoreAudio driver support simultaneous use of multiple client applications?</span><br><span>A:</span> Yes. Beginning with version 6.5 and higher, the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver supports multiple CoreAudio clients. You no longer have to quit a CoreAudio application before working with another.</p><p><span>Q: Can I use Pro Tools in tandem with other CoreAudio applications?<br> A:</span> No. Pro Tools requires exclusive access to Digidesign hardware and thus it cannot be used simultaneously with other CoreAudio applications. You will have to quit Pro Tools before using other CoreAudio programs, or vice versa.</p><p><span>Q: Why can't I hear my Mac system sounds through my Digidesign hardware using the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver?<br> A:</span> The Digidesign CoreAudio Driver for Mac OS X does not support playback of system sounds. Your Mac system sounds will continue to be available through your Mac speaker and regular Mac line out.</p><p><span>Q: Why doesn't the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver for OS X allow the volume output or input to be adjusted in the OS X Sound Preference Panel? The volume sliders are greyed out.<br> A:</span>This is correct behavior. The Digidesign CoreAudio Driver does not support this function. Playback volume adjustments can be made within the Digi CoreAudio Manager application.</p><p><span>Q: Will Pro Tools 24 MIX, Pro Tools 24, Digi 001, or Audiomedia III hardware work? I can't find them listed under supported systems.<br> A:</span> Pro Tools 24 MIX, Pro Tools 24 (d24 card), Digi 001, and Audiomedia III hardware have not been tested with Mac OS X 10.4, and there is no version of Pro Tools for Mac OS X 10.4 that supports this hardware. While you can try the Digidesign CoreAudo Driver with these discontinued systems, they may not work.</p><p><span>Q: What about compatibility with Mac OS X 10.3 'Panther' and 10.2.x 'Jaguar', with or without Pro Tools installed?<br> A:</span> The Digidesign CoreAudio Driver for Mac OS X 10.4 'Tiger' has not been tested with Mac OS X 10.3 or 10.2. We recommend that you use the correct version of the driver for your version of Mac OS X.</p><p>The Digidesign CoreAudio driver version 6.9 for Mac OS X 10.3.x can be downloaded here:</p><p>The Digidesign CoreAudio driver version 6.1.2 for Mac OS X 10.2.x can be downloaded here:</p><p><span>Q: What OS X applications work with the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver v7.0?<br> A:</span> With a few possible exceptions, any CoreAudio-compatible application will work with the Digidesign CoreAudio driver. The following third-party CoreAudio-compatible client applications have been tested with the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver v7.0:</p><ul><li>Ignition Pack</li><li> Ableton Live 4.1x</li><li> Reason 3.04</li><li> Cubase SX3</li><li> Apple GarageBand 2.0.2</li><li> Apple iLife v5</li><li> Apple Quicktime 7.x</li><li> RealOne 10.x</li><li> Roxio Toast with Jam 6.x</li></ul><p>See the CoreAudio Read Me (42 included with download) for additional information and known issues. </p><p><span>Q: How can you avoid distortion and audio sync errors when using Logic Audio with the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver?<br> A: </span>In our testing, we found that Logic will not play audio properly through the CoreAudio driver until you go into the driver preferences, and manually reset the buffer size to another setting (it defaults to 512, and it can be switched back to 512, but it needs to be set to another value first). if you don't do this, Logic plays the file back with distortion and you will eventually get an audio sync error. Once you've manually changed the buffer size, this problem goes away.</p><img src='https://media.karousell.com/media/photos/products/2020/02/08/avid_mbox_pro_3rd_gen_1581155333_90cf4171_progressive.jpg' alt='Mbox pro 2 driver for mac' title='Mbox pro 2 driver for mac'><p><span>Q: How do you configure Roxio Toast or Jam to use the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver?<br> A: </span>In Roxio Toast 5.2 or Jam 5.01, set the Sound Out to Mac OS X Audio HAL. Jam v6 allows either Mac OS X Audio HAL or Digidesign HW. Toast v6 will automatically default to whichever hardware is selected in the Sound control panel.</p><p><span>Q: Is there still an 'opt-in' list?<br> A:</span> No. Because of its ability to work with multiple clients, the Digidesign CoreAudio driver no longer requires an 'opt-in' list. To exclude applications from access to the Digidesign CoreAudio driver, press and hold down the Shift key when lanching an application. Please see the Digidesign CoreAudio usage guide for more information.</p><p><span>Q: What are the limitations of the Digidesign CoreAudio Driver?<br> A:</span> As listed in the Digidesign CoreAudio Read Me:</p><ul><li>The multi-client CoreAudio Driver cannot be used to preview sound files in Macintosh Finder. When you view a sound file Mac OS X Finder window with files displayed by columns, a preview bar is displayed next to it. This preview bar lets you audition the sound file. The sound will always play back though the Macintosh’s built-in audio controller (through the Macintosh’s speaker or headphone jack). However, if you double-click a sound file, the QuickTime application will launch, and can use the multi-client Digidesign CoreAudio Driver for playback.</li><li>The multi-client Digidesign CoreAudio Driver cannot be used for playback of System Sounds.</li></ul><p>Installing the Standalone Digidesign CoreAudio Driver v7.0</p><p>The download includes a complete installer application.
